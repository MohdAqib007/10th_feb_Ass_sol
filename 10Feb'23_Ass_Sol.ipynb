    "1. To release system resources: When you open a file, your operating system allocates certain resources to that file. These resources may include memory and file handles. \n",
    "If you don't close the file, these resources will continue to be tied up, which can lead to problems if you have a large number of open files.\n",

    "If you don't close the file, the data may not be written to disk immediately, which means that some or all of your changes may be lost if your program crashes or the system fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To prevent data corruption: If you try to open a file that is already open in another program, you may get an error or corrupt the data in the file. \n",
    "By closing the file when you're done with it, you ensure that other programs can access it if needed, and that your changes are saved correctly.\n",
